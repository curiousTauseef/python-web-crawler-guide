python-web-crawler-guide
========================

Project guide for a python web crawler project.  Made for the Python stride on 01/29/14.

## How to use this guide
As Zed Shaw states on his site programming-motherfucker.com, the best way to learn programming is to, well, "Program, motherfucker."  Don't just copy and paste the code from this guide, or just settle for reading through and "understanding" the code.  Understanding comes through doing, so open up that terminal and start writing.

## What is a Web Crawler?

From Wikipedia, "A web crawler is an Internet bot that systematically indexes the World Wide Web, typically for the purpose of Web indexing".  This basically means that you start with a page or set of web pages, find all the links in those pages, and get the pages from those links, and then the links on those pages... etc.  As you can see, this is an instrisically recursive process.

Google uses web crawlers to index the web, web crawlers that take into consideration the quality of the content, how many times a web page has already been "crawled" on, and much more.  Ours will obviously be much simpler.  This is just to show you after you get this working, there is still much more that can be done to enhance it.

## Alright, let's code
